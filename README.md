User Stories:
1. I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016) 
<br>
2. If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
<br>
3. If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
